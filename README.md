# Fnaf_Remake


## What I learned 
In creating this project, I refined my skills in utilizing random numbers to create a sense of opposition in gameplay. 

## Features
- Two Difficulty Modes: Easy mode and Hard mode
- Randomized ai moves
- Simple and clear gameplay
- Main menu functionality


## Winning Example
12 A.M.<br>
Power left: 85<br>
Enter a door number to check for Freddy (1-5): 3<br>

You found Freddy!! He was behind door 3. You survived!<br>
Entering main menu...<br>


## Losing Example
5 A.M.<br>
Power left: 15<br>
Enter a door number to check for Freddy (1-5): 4<br>

Freddy was not behind door 4.<br>
You've run out of power!! Freddy has come out door 2 and killed you. Better luck next time! :)<br>
Entering main menu...<br>
